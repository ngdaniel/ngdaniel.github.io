        <h3>A Happy Mistake</h3>

<p>Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

<p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. We'll have a super time.</p>

<p>In your world you can create anything you desire. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>

<p>A happy cloud. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Here we're limited by the time we have.</p>

<p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. We have a fantastic little sky! God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. A beautiful little sunset.</p>

<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>

<p>Get tough with it, get strong. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.</p>
